"""Request and response schemas.

The `QueryResponse` below IS the format we grade. Every `POST /query` call also writes
its response to `data/out/` as a JSON file. To submit, copy the content of your preferred
answers from `data/out/` into the matching files under `submission/` and push. See
`submission/README.md`. You never have to hand-write this JSON — it comes straight out of
the endpoint (visible in Swagger at `/docs` and in the Postman collection).
