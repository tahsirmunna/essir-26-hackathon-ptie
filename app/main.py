DESCRIPTION = """
A retrieval-augmented-generation backend over **one PDF you choose**, for the AI Multimedia
Lab hackathon at ESSIR 2026 (*The Fourth Turn*).

### Flow

1. Put your document in `data/in/`.
2. **`POST /ingest`** — parse it, embed it, index it in Qdrant. (Out of the box: one vector
   per page, local sentence-transformers embeddings. No chunking yet — that is yours to add.)
3. **`POST /query`** — ask a question at a level (1, 2 or 3). You get an answer with its
   sources, and a copy is written to `data/out/`.

### The three levels

- **1 · retrieval** — a standalone question. The baseline handles these.
- **2 · memory** — a follow-up; level-2 questions share a conversation so your system can
  use the history. Resolve the follow-up *before* retrieval.
- **3 · reasoning** — questions no single passage answers. This is where you build.

Everything worth improving is marked `TODO(level-N)` in `app/rag/` and `app/rag/embeddings.py`.
This is an **open-source** challenge — any model you can host on your own machine is fair game.
