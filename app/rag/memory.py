"""Conversation memory — where Level 2 lives.

A Level-2 question is a follow-up: *"and how large is its test split?"* only makes
sense given the earlier turn it refers to. To answer it you need the history of the
conversation it belongs to.

The baseline stores history in a process-local dict, which is enough to demonstrate
the idea but forgets everything on restart and does not scale past one worker.

# TODO(level-2): history alone is not enough. The retrieval step still embeds the

#   leverage fix is to REWRITE the question into a standalone query using this history
#   BEFORE retrieving — see rag/retrieve.py::rewrite_query.
# TODO(level-2): a persistent, shared store (Redis, Postgres, ...) if you run more
#   than one worker or want memory to survive a restart.
