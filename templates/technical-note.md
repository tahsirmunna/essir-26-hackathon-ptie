# Technical note — Team <name>

**Two pages.** Evidence-dense beats long. Commit it to your fork as `TECHNICAL_NOTE.md`
and delete this guidance before submitting.

It supports your Friday presentation and lets us check that your `results/` came from a
system you actually built. Graded on: claim-to-evidence, technical accuracy, solution
design, **insight and measurement**, AI-slop (inverse). See
[`../docs/05_evaluation.md`](../docs/05_evaluation.md).

## 1. System

*One paragraph and a pipeline sketch. What happens to a question from `POST /query` to the
returned answer? Name the models, the embedding model, the chunking, the retrieval. A reader
should be able to redraw your `app/rag/` from this.*

| Stage | What you did | Changed from the scaffold? |
|---|---|---|
| Extraction | | |
| Chunking | | |
| Embeddings / index | | |
| Retrieval | | |
| Answer + citation | | |

## 2. Level 2 — conversational memory

*How does a follow-up become answerable? Show a real example from the Level-2 questions: the
raw follow-up, and the standalone query your system produced from the history.*

```
q5 as asked:     "Why does that happen?"
rewritten query: "..."
```

## 3. Level 3 — whole-document reasoning

*What did you build beyond single-shot retrieval — multi-hop, agentic retrieval, a second
index, table handling, a graph? What worked, what didn't?*

## 4. Measurement

*The heaviest-weighted section. Numbers you produced on your own system.*

- How do your answers do per level? Where does it break down — Level 3?
- At least one **ablation**: something you changed and its effect. "Adding query rewriting
  fixed 2 of 3 Level-2 questions" with the before/after beats any unmeasured claim.
- Cost: what does a query cost you (tokens, latency), from your `diagnostics`?

## 5. What broke

*One failure you diagnosed — which stage, how you found it, what you did or why you left it.
An honest negative result scores above an unexamined success.*

## 6. Limitations and next steps

*What your system does not do, and what you would build with another day.*
